<strong>Instructions:</strong>

ðŸ‘‰ Find a concept, an idea, or a thought online about a best practice related to web development or software engineering that can be summarized into a statement. Its source can be just be a tweet, or a whole blog post, or from a book, etc.<br /><br />
ðŸ‘‰ Use the statement as a title, then add a description explaining it in your own words, just like how you did in the pre-course's Feyman writing prompts.<br /><br />
ðŸ‘‰ Present this using HTML & CSS on an HTML page.<br /><br />
ðŸ‘‰ Include the link of the source in the HTML page (however you choose to cite it).<br /><br />
ðŸ‘‰ Push your work to a new repo in your Github account, then send me the link in our Slack channel.<br /><br />
ðŸ‘‰ This is your chance to get adventurous and creative so we expect you to immerse yourself in HTML & CSS alongside web development concepts.<br /><br />
